# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.**

You may submit a report via telegram to project founder [@exg1o](https://t.me/exg1o).

This project is maintained by volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. Please give 30 days to work on a fix before public exposure, reducing the chance that an exploit will be used before a patch is released.
